## Project Flow

* Data pre-processing 
* Analysis of Department wise performance and Label Encoding the ordinal columns.
* Splitting the data into test and train.
* Training the data using algorithms like Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, XGBoost Classifier and checking the accuracy to find out which algorithm is the best.
* Exporting the model with highest accuracy

## Results
The top 3 features effecting employee performances are:
* Employee Environment Satisfaction (40%)
* Employee Last Salary Hike Percent (33.3%)
